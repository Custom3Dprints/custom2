#At one college, the tuition for a full-time student is $8,000 per semester. 
# It has been announced that the tuition will increase by 3 percent each year for the next 5 years. 
# Write a program with a loop that displays the projected semester tuition amount for the next 5 years.
#Your programâ€™s output must exactly match the output shown in the sample run below. 
# Notice the wording of the messages and the placement of spaces and punctuation. 
# Also, make sure that the tuition amounts are rounded to two decimal places.
#Sample Run
#In 1 year, the tuition will be $8240.00.
#In 2 years, the tuition will be $8487.20.
#In 3 years, the tuition will be $8741.82.
#In 4 years, the tuition will be $9004.07.
